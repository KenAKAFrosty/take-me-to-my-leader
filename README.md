# It begins

### Roadmap/TODO

#### MVP:
1) ~~Get IP from request~~
2) ~~Geolocate (I believe it's easiest to find as a zip)~~
3) ~~Get City/County/State~~
    - Because of the accuracy of geolocating from IP, it seems like less friction to focus on county instead of city - but that said, city officials are an important part of this too, so it's something to consider down the road
4) ~~Identify the political leaders associated with city/county/state~~
5) ~~Map those leaders to email addresses~~
6) ~~Generate basic templates as text "Hi, {leaderName}, I live in {county} and..."~~
7) ~~One tap to copy that template to clipboard, open link to email the proper address (with subject line too possibly?)~~

#### Additional:
- Guiding/helping choose which leader is most appropriate for which issue. Probably questionnaire/chatbot style. Just get the general theme of the issue they want to communicate about, then choose proper leader accordingly
- Little sliding notifications out of the main viewing area for when someone else clicks their button, e.g., "Someone in Detroit, MI just contacted one of their leaders!"
- Maybe even long term stats over time. Simple stuff just like "here's how many people in your state have used this just this week". that kind of thing
- A "Most Contacted Officials" page
- Option for browser notifications for reminders to do it again (in a month, etc..) Same for adding to calendar
- Before sophisticated selection is a thing, would be a nice feature to do a little "roulette" type wheel to sorta gamify it and make it exciting to see which one you get
- Icons/images for the state you're in
- More to come
