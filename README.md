# It begins

### Roadmap/TODO

#### MVP:
1) Get IP from request
2) Geolocate (I believe it's easiest to find as a zip)
3) Get City/County/State 
    - Because of the accuracy of geolocating from IP, it seems like less friction to focus on county instead of city - but that said, city officials are an important part of this too, so it's something to consider down the road
4) Identify the political leaders associated with city/county/state
5) Map those leaders to email addresses
6) Generate basic templates as text "Hi, {leaderName}, I live in {county} and..."
7) One tap to copy that template to clipboard, open link to email the proper address (with subject line too possibly?)

#### Additional:
- Guiding/helping choose which leader is most appropriate for which issue. Probably questionnaire/chatbot style. Just get the general theme of the issue they want to communicate about, then choose proper leader accordingly
- Little sliding notifications out of the main viewing area for when someone else clicks their button, e.g., "Someone in Detroit, MI just contacted one of their leaders!"
- Maybe even long term stats over time. Simple stuff just like "here's how many people in your state have used this just this week". that kind of thing
- More to come
